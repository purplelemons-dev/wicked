# Wicked

wicked is a highly customizable discord bot written in python. It offers web customization, content filtering, minigames, and more!

## Installation
As of right now, you can download the source directory (`./src/`) and rename it to `wicked` or `wickedbot` or something and add it to your python package directory.

To find your python package directory, run:
```bash
python -m site
```
And copy the `USER_SITE` value. (Create it if it doesn't exist using the given path.)

After doing this, you can import wicked like any other python package using whatever name you gave the source directory.
